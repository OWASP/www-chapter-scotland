Join us at the OWASP Scotland Chapter Meeting where we have an exciting talk lined up focusing on mainframe hacking alongside a brief update from the OWASP Scotland Chapter leaders on OWASP flagship projects and global events.

This event is perfect for software developers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts interested in learning about the latest trends in cyber security.

#### Talk 1 - A tale of two Fortiinets
**Speaker**: Jim Slaughter

Most large organizations monitor their brand space for infringement from things like typosquating. This can turn up interesting results at different times.
In July 2024, FortiGuard Labs came across one such typosquatted domain, Fortiinet.com. The domain was registered a few months prior and did an excellent job impersonating our trade dress. In addition to being an excellent facsimile, the site was also dropping an infostealer, Lumma. The goal of this presentation is to detail the efforts we took to find and investigate the domain and infostealer.

#### Talk 2 – Global Insights from Security Leaders across the Globe
**Speaker**: James Walsh

Explanation of findings from Hays Global Cyber Survey, looking at Talent, AI, Cyber Budgets and Risks.

**Speaker bio:**

James Walsh CISMP- Director of Cyber Security Practice UK&I has over 14 years of experience working specifically within the Cyber Security sector supporting a variety of industries with there Talent and Project Requirements.

#### Talk 3 – Cross-Site Scripting Beyond Alert(1)
**Speaker**: Paul Johnston

XSS is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. Most proof-of-concept exploits simply display an alert box, proving that JavaScript code has been executed. This talk explores what an attacker can do beyond an alert box, to maliciously exploit an XSS flaw. We investigate how browser security features such as HttpOnly cookies and Content-Security-Policy can be bypassed, in certain circumstances. And we look some difficult XSS scenarios, that are not detected by leading scanners, but can be exploited with a carefully crafted payload.

**Speaker bio:**

Paul is a security consultant at Pentest, specialising in web applications, and particularly in securing cloud-native, multi-tenant, SaaS platforms. He has worked in security for a number of year, and previously was a software developer and sys-admin.

#### Talk 2 - Clean Rooms, Nuclear Missiles and SideCopy, Oh My!

Occasionally, FortiGuard Labs researchers come across a file name or e-mail subject that makes us sit up and take notice. Of course, it may turn out to be nothing. But every once in a while, one of these turns out to be incredibly interesting.

We recently came across one such file that referenced an Indian state military research organization and an in-development nuclear missile. The file was meant to deploy malware with characteristics matching the APT group “SideCopy”. With activities dating back to at least 2019, this group has aligned its targeting with the goals and objectives of the Pakistani government.

#### Meeting the Ministrer

Things not always being as they seem is a common adage that lends itself well to the cyber world. Phishing tries explicitly to convince an email recipient that a message is legitimate and trustworthy when it is not. This applies equally to cases where the sender is interested in criminal exploits or nation-state activity.

FortiGuard Labs recently came across an unassuming phishing email that proved to be far more than it initially seemed. Written in Russian, it attempts to lure the recipient into deploying malware on their system. This talk will cover the analysis of that malware which happens to have been Konni - a remote administration tool (RAT) that has been tied to the group APT 37 (aka: Ricochet Chollima, InkySquid, ScarCruft, Reaper, and Group123). This group has been known to align its targeting and objectives with those of the government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly known as North Korea.

#### Open Source Software Supply Chains

As modern software development evolves; we no longer build things from the ground up. Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.

#### Scale Your Security by Embracing Secure Defaults & Eliminating Bug Classes

We’re in the middle of a significant shift in how security teams operate and prioritize their limited budget and person-time. Historically, as an industry, we’ve focused on building tools to identify vulnerabilities. While we’ve built impressive tools, these approaches have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams. Specifically, these tools often are too slow, require a prohibitive amount of security engineer time and domain expertise to tune, overwhelm users with false positives, and most importantly, do not ultimately raise a company’s security bar. But there’s another way. Rather than investing in finding more bugs, some modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (“guard rails”) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks that enforce invariants (properties that must always hold), organizations can solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole. In this talk, we’ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:

* Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on
* How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes
* How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that’s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers
* How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company

#### Rory McCune (@raesene)
Abstract – The world of containerization can be a morass of new and odd sounding acronyms and terms. However when you start to dig into what’s really happening with Docker, Kubernetes et al, you will find that there’s a lot of familiar technologies involved which can have existing approaches to security applied to them. This talk aims to demystify the container security world and explain some of the underlying concepts”.

#### STÖK - Bounty curious? How to win at bug bounties in 2020 (and stay sane)
**Speaker**: STÖK - @stokfredrik, youtube.com/stokfredrik

STÖK will be providing us insight into how to approach bug bounties as a hobby in 2020, what tools most people use, why you need automation, understanding depth vs. breadth, fuzzing vs code review; and how to stay sane whilst competing against 700,000 other hackers.

#### Context IS - Open Banking Applications
**Speaker**: Margus Lind & Daniela Schoeffmann, Context IS

Open Banking is the UK implementation for PSD2. On top of the PSD2 regulations, Open Banking provides a detailed specification for banks and third parties to follow when communicating with one another. This allows companies (TPPs) to build their applications and integrate with online services exposed by any bank (ASPSP) in a standardised way.

With an increasing number of banks using APIs to share data, Open Banking promises better business opportunities and more robust security for customers and banks. However, implementation of publicly accessible APIs and introduction of new security models create a myriad of challenges. This makes for a wider attack surface and puts data in the hands of more companies (third party providers) who have differing approaches to customer data protection. In this talk we will cover a brief introduction to Open Banking, our experiences with testing implementations of Open Banking, as well as the technical and project management challenges we have overcome along the way. We will demonstrate the technical complexities encountered, and share some interesting discoveries made during the engagements.
