#### Open Source Software Supply Chains

As modern software development evolves; we no longer build things from the ground up. Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.

#### Scale Your Security by Embracing Secure Defaults & Eliminating Bug Classes

We’re in the middle of a significant shift in how security teams operate and prioritize their limited budget and person-time. Historically, as an industry, we’ve focused on building tools to identify vulnerabilities. While we’ve built impressive tools, these approaches have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams. Specifically, these tools often are too slow, require a prohibitive amount of security engineer time and domain expertise to tune, overwhelm users with false positives, and most importantly, do not ultimately raise a company’s security bar. But there’s another way. Rather than investing in finding more bugs, some modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (“guard rails”) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks that enforce invariants (properties that must always hold), organizations can solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole. In this talk, we’ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:

* Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on
* How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes
* How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that’s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers
* How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company

#### Rory McCune (@raesene)
Abstract – The world of containerization can be a morass of new and odd sounding acronyms and terms. However when you start to dig into what’s really happening with Docker, Kubernetes et al, you will find that there’s a lot of familiar technologies involved which can have existing approaches to security applied to them. This talk aims to demystify the container security world and explain some of the underlying concepts”.
Bio - Rory has worked in the Information and IT Security arena for the last 20 years in a variety of roles. These days he spends most of his work time on application, cloud and container security. He's an active member of the UK information security community having delivered presentations at a variety of IT and Information security conferences. He has also presented at major containerization conferences and is an author of the CIS Benchmarks for Docker and Kubernetes.

#### STÖK - Bounty curious? How to win at bug bounties in 2020 (and stay sane)
**Speaker**: STÖK - @stokfredrik, youtube.com/stokfredrik

STÖK will be providing us insight into how to approach bug bounties as a hobby in 2020, what tools most people use, why you need automation, understanding depth vs. breadth, fuzzing vs code review; and how to stay sane whilst competing against 700,000 other hackers.

#### Context IS - Open Banking Applications
**Speaker**: Margus Lind & Daniela Schoeffmann, Context IS

Open Banking is the UK implementation for PSD2. On top of the PSD2 regulations, Open Banking provides a detailed specification for banks and third parties to follow when communicating with one another. This allows companies (TPPs) to build their applications and integrate with online services exposed by any bank (ASPSP) in a standardised way.

With an increasing number of banks using APIs to share data, Open Banking promises better business opportunities and more robust security for customers and banks. However, implementation of publicly accessible APIs and introduction of new security models create a myriad of challenges. This makes for a wider attack surface and puts data in the hands of more companies (third party providers) who have differing approaches to customer data protection. In this talk we will cover a brief introduction to Open Banking, our experiences with testing implementations of Open Banking, as well as the technical and project management challenges we have overcome along the way. We will demonstrate the technical complexities encountered, and share some interesting discoveries made during the engagements.

#### Security Culture and Behaviour - security is still often seen as a technology problem
**Speaker**: Louise MacDougall

This presentation will focus on the culture and behaviours surrounding cyber security and explore the 'People layer' of defence. Louise will discuss how organisations should be approaching cyber security leadership and how they can drive the right security behaviours within their staff. Particular focus will be on the role of senior leadership and behavioural models that can be applied to cyber security.

#### Nothing Rhymes with Purple
**Speaker**: Lawrence Munro

In this talk, I discuss the need for collaborative strategies between blue and red teams. I dive deep into the concepts of ‘always-on’ red teaming and the processes of generating use cases from TI through threat hunting to validation. I also discuss the use of point-in-time purple teaming and maximising the value to the SOC. Moreover, I will discuss the direction of travel within the professional services industry and open the floor to discussion.

Bio: Lawrence Munro is Technical Director at NCC Group, a Post-Graduate Student at Oxford University, a CREST Executive member and Director for B-Sides London. His research (and presentation topics) are varied, but often include: red teaming, education in InfoSec and weird side-projects. Lawrence has previously presented his ideas and research at: Black Hat USA, DEFCON, 44CON, RootCon, B-Sides (Various), ToorCon.
