#### Description
The final OWASP Scotland Chapter meeting of 2019 will take place on Thursday the 21st of November. Many thanks to Deloitte, who has kindly offered to host this event for us. They will also be providing pizza and refreshments on the evening.

We have two great talks lined up for the OWASP Scotland community with Rob McElvanney on "Red Teaming: Simply the BEST" and Colin Cassidy giving us an insight into the "Adventures in the wacky world of control systems".

For attending this event you will be able to claim 2 CPE points.

##### Red Teaming: Simply the BEST
**Speaker:** Rob McElvanney, Deloitte

Using examples of real world attacks, Associate Director Rob McElvanney will discuss lessons learned from recent Red Team exercises, particularly within the CBEST and GBEST frameworks. This session will illustrate some of the methods used by advanced actors to achieve access, allowing them a foothold for lateral movement and privilege escalation. The session will also explore how organisations can improve their chances of defending against such adversaries.

##### Adventures in the wacky world of control systems
**Speaker:** Colin Cassidy

This talk is a grab bag of different ICS topics to give people a flavours of the challenges being faced. The focus will be primarily on the energy industry, but other ICS and critical infrastructure faces similar issues. We will briefly discuss control system changes over time, what caused those changes, what improvements (or not) that they brought. We will cover some real life findings and thoughts from the field, this will include some odd findings, commonly seen issues, and how mistakes can cause surprisingly kinetic problems!

More positively there are solutions and improvements, but a one-size-fits-all solution does not tend to work, even when dealing with very similar sites.
