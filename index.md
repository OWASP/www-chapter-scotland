Join us at the OWASP Scotland Chapter Meeting where we have two exciting talks lined up focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) security and risk aspects; as well as a deep dive into the recent "iSOON Leak".

This event is perfect for software developers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts interested in learning about the latest trends in cyber security.

#### Talk 1 - Large Language Models (LLMs) and Risk Management

**Speakers**: Jason Fish and Jamie Cranmer

This talk will cover the below talking points:
1. Introduction to LLMs - Overview of Generative AI and potential Use Cases
2. LLM Risk - Risks associated with LLM and how they differ from other types of AI
3. AI Risk management and ML Ops - Core capabilities that support the management of AI and Generative AI risks

#### Talk 2 â€“ The iSOON Leak: What Is It and How to Analyse It
**Speaker**: Jim Slaughter

In late February, an unusual event occurred. While it was widely known the PRC was actively engaged in espionage around the world, glimpses into how this was done were few and far between. Then a repo appeared on GitHub.
The iSOON leak has revealed a significant amount of information about the internal operations and capabilities of a state-affiliated hacking contractor in China. Given the challenges of analysing a large trove of files (often without the aid of a native language speaker), new ways of utilizing technology (including AI) were needed to fully understand this dataset.
