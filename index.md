This event is perfect for software developers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts interested in learning about the latest trends in cyber security.

#### Talk 1 - Everything Wrong with Dependency Track
**Speaker**: Dr. Lionel Saliou

A humorous look back on a project I conducted at my current employer that led to the use (or misuse some might say) of the OWASP flagship project: Dependency Track. This talk provides the context to these decisions and extracts nuggets of wisdom that I believe will be valuable to many security professionals.

**About the speaker:** My name is Dr. Lionel Saliou, Ph.D and I have nearly 2 decades of application security experience. In the past I may have written bugs to remain gainfully employed, nowadays, I am a recovering developer supporting development teams write better software.

#### Talk 2 - Vulnerability Disclosure & Bug Bounty Programmes – The Good, the Bad and the Ugly [Revisited]
**Speaker**: Rob Jansson

In this talk we’ll discuss the benefits and challenges of running both Vulnerability Disclosure and Bug Bounty programmes; and the different ways an organisation can run these. Are they actually that useful or are they just ‘security botox’ to look pretty on the outside…
