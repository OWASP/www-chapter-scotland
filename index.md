Join us at the OWASP Scotland Chapter Meeting where we have an exciting talk lined up focusing on mainframe hacking alongside a brief update from the OWASP Scotland Chapter leaders on OWASP flagship projects and global events.

This event is perfect for software developers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts interested in learning about the latest trends in cyber security.

#### Talk 1 - OWASP Update
**Speakers**: Rob Jansson, Sean Wright and Jim Slaughter

#### Talk 2 â€“ Hacking the Crown Jewels - The Mainframe!
**Speaker**: Kev Milne & Hubert Januzewski

'The Mainframe' is often overlooked as a legacy system that holds little importance in today's computing world. It is certainly seen as some mystical black box that should not be touched. The lack of access to Mainframes such as the IBM zSeries often does not make it easy to conduct research on these systems that process billions of transactions per year and hold sensitive data.

During this talk we will give an insight into the history of Mainframes, some of their weaknesses (and strengths) and demonstrate some of the tools and exploitation techniques that can be used to assess, gain a foothold, and escalate privileges to SPECIAL. Finally, we will provide information on where to start learning about Mainframes with special attention paid to tapping into the free resources and emulators that exist out there.
