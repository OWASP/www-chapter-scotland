#### Elevate your AppSec Program with the OWASP JuiceShop Project

Dan Gora will give an introduction to the OWASP JuiceShop, the German OWASP flagship project and one of the most likely sophisticated insecure web applications. Dan demonstrates how to get started with hands-on application security learning by walking through OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in the JuiceShop. This includes vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting and code injection. Furthermore, it will be shown how the OWASP Juice Shop can be used for security training, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for testing your security tooling.
