#### Meeting the Ministrer

Things not always being as they seem is a common adage that lends itself well to the cyber world. Phishing tries explicitly to convince an email recipient that a message is legitimate and trustworthy when it is not. This applies equally to cases where the sender is interested in criminal exploits or nation-state activity.

FortiGuard Labs recently came across an unassuming phishing email that proved to be far more than it initially seemed. Written in Russian, it attempts to lure the recipient into deploying malware on their system. This talk will cover the analysis of that malware which happens to have been Konni - a remote administration tool (RAT) that has been tied to the group APT 37 (aka: Ricochet Chollima, InkySquid, ScarCruft, Reaper, and Group123). This group has been known to align its targeting and objectives with those of the government of the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly known as North Korea.
