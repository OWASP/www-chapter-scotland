#### Security Culture and Behaviour - security is still often seen as a technology problem
**Speaker**: Louise MacDougall

This presentation will focus on the culture and behaviours surrounding cyber security and explore the 'People layer' of defence. Louise will discuss how organisations should be approaching cyber security leadership and how they can drive the right security behaviours within their staff. Particular focus will be on the role of senior leadership and behavioural models that can be applied to cyber security.

#### Nothing Rhymes with Purple
**Speaker**: Lawrence Munro

In this talk, I discuss the need for collaborative strategies between blue and red teams. I dive deep into the concepts of ‘always-on’ red teaming and the processes of generating use cases from TI through threat hunting to validation. I also discuss the use of point-in-time purple teaming and maximising the value to the SOC. Moreover, I will discuss the direction of travel within the professional services industry and open the floor to discussion.

Bio: Lawrence Munro is Technical Director at NCC Group, a Post-Graduate Student at Oxford University, a CREST Executive member and Director for B-Sides London. His research (and presentation topics) are varied, but often include: red teaming, education in InfoSec and weird side-projects. Lawrence has previously presented his ideas and research at: Black Hat USA, DEFCON, 44CON, RootCon, B-Sides (Various), ToorCon.
