This event is perfect for software developers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts interested in learning about the latest trends in cyber security.

#### Talk 1 - Trojan Horsepower: Leveraging Power line Communication to Attack Electric Charging Stations
**Speaker**: Peter Lewis - Ethical Hacking Center of Excellence, PwC

As electric vehicles become integrated into government fleets, and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) subsequently becomes critical national infrastructure,
EVSE security is more relevant than ever. This talk introduces the basic technologies behind EV charging infrastructure, and two novel attack methods: one for scanning electric chargers using an unmodified consumer Ethernet power line adapter and another for launching a Denial of Service (DoS) attack with the same tool.

#### Talk 2 – Poor state of InfoSec tooling
**Speaker**: Sean Wright

In this talk I'll cover the poor state of many of the security toolsets. Why we need to start holding vendors to account and why we need to look beyond the hype of tooling when choosing tools. This will be an interactive talk as well.

#### Talk 3 – All these secrets...
**Speaker**: Rob Jansson

In this talk, we'll explore the risks associated with the leakage of 'secrets', such as passwords, API keys, and more, within an organisation's integrations including version control systems, artifact repositories, CI / CD pipelines, chat apps and ticketing systems to name a few... We'll also dive into possible strategies and tools for detecting and preventing these vulnerabilities, to help safeguard your systems and organisation from external threat actors and malicious insiders.
