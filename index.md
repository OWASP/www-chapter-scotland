#### Rory McCune (@raesene)
Abstract – The world of containerization can be a morass of new and odd sounding acronyms and terms. However when you start to dig into what’s really happening with Docker, Kubernetes et al, you will find that there’s a lot of familiar technologies involved which can have existing approaches to security applied to them. This talk aims to demystify the container security world and explain some of the underlying concepts”.
Bio - Rory has worked in the Information and IT Security arena for the last 20 years in a variety of roles. These days he spends most of his work time on application, cloud and container security. He's an active member of the UK information security community having delivered presentations at a variety of IT and Information security conferences. He has also presented at major containerization conferences and is an author of the CIS Benchmarks for Docker and Kubernetes.
