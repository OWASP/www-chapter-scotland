#### Talk 1 - Cyber as a Science

In this talk, I discuss the importance of the scientific method within the Cybersecurity industry and the challenges created by pseudoscience and guff. I will also examine the issues with current efforts in this space, such as: the limited relevance of academia, the challenges of getting access to relevant data, the rapidly changing threat landscape and persistence in creating analogues to military doctrine.
