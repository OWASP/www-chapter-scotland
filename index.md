#### Open Source Software Supply Chains

As modern software development evolves; we no longer build things from the ground up. Extensive use is made of open source software such as libraries and frameworks. While this is fantastic from a development point of view (allowing for faster development of applications and features), it does present a potential drawback if not done correctly, an increased risk. Often, we see libraries being used and seldom updated, also we see several libraries being blindly with little to not inspections and reviews. This is gold mine for attackers, there are many ways that they have will continue to use this to their advantage. The purpose of this talk is to cover some of the techniques which attackers could use to exploit open source supply chains. This will include a live demonstration of one such technique which an attacker could used. The talk will then focus on the excellent OWASP Dependency Track tool, showing how this can help reduce the risk to organizations when it comes to dealing with open source packages in software.
