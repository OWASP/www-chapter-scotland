#### Talk 1 - A tale of two Fortiinets
**Speaker**: Jim Slaughter

Most large organizations monitor their brand space for infringement from things like typosquating. This can turn up interesting results at different times.
In July 2024, FortiGuard Labs came across one such typosquatted domain, Fortiinet.com. The domain was registered a few months prior and did an excellent job impersonating our trade dress. In addition to being an excellent facsimile, the site was also dropping an infostealer, Lumma. The goal of this presentation is to detail the efforts we took to find and investigate the domain and infostealer.

#### Talk 3 – Cross-Site Scripting Beyond Alert(1)
**Speaker**: Paul Johnston

XSS is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. Most proof-of-concept exploits simply display an alert box, proving that JavaScript code has been executed. This talk explores what an attacker can do beyond an alert box, to maliciously exploit an XSS flaw. We investigate how browser security features such as HttpOnly cookies and Content-Security-Policy can be bypassed, in certain circumstances. And we look some difficult XSS scenarios, that are not detected by leading scanners, but can be exploited with a carefully crafted payload.

**Speaker bio:**

Paul is a security consultant at Pentest, specialising in web applications, and particularly in securing cloud-native, multi-tenant, SaaS platforms. He has worked in security for a number of year, and previously was a software developer and sys-admin.
