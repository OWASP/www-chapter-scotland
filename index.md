#### Talk 1 - Insights from the Hays Global Cyber Report

#### Talk 2 - Clean Rooms, Nuclear Missiles and SideCopy, Oh My!

Occasionally, FortiGuard Labs researchers come across a file name or e-mail subject that makes us sit up and take notice. Of course, it may turn out to be nothing. But every once in a while, one of these turns out to be incredibly interesting.

We recently came across one such file that referenced an Indian state military research organization and an in-development nuclear missile. The file was meant to deploy malware with characteristics matching the APT group “SideCopy”. With activities dating back to at least 2019, this group has aligned its targeting with the goals and objectives of the Pakistani government.
